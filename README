#2024 Advent of Code
These are my [2024 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions. 

This is my first year doing it, so I don't have a particularly focused goal other than to keep myself actively engaged and abreast of new concepts in langauges and tools I am interested in. Right now I'm starting with C++, but leaving myself room to experiment with other languages, hence the separation of puzzles by language. I may mess around with learning SIMD intrinsics, certain libraries, techniques, etc... and I have placed no restrictions on myself on how the problems are solved. That means STL, external libraries, and constexpr eval are all on the table.

Happy coding!
